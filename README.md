# Project Introduction

## Title

Database for input hours pickers

## Description

Write a website for entering hours/picking by pickers.

Home page:

 - first line - the field where we select the date (the other lines are not yet available until you select the date);
-second line - day settings (button) opens another page of the site where you can select picking numbers (1 or 2 or 3), mushroom codes (43, 142, 170, 323, 330, 423, 424, 432, 449, 454, 457, 473, 493, 787, 788, 1000), tunnel numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), picker codes (all letters of the alphabet in uppercase). Save the selected ones for this selected date and return to the main page.

- third line - two buttons - "Enter hours" and "Enter picking";

1) If you have selected "Entering the picking":

-Fourth line - the field where you select the picking number from the list of those selected earlier in the settings;
- fifth line - the field where you select the tunnel number from the list of tunnels selected earlier in the settings;
- the sixth line is the field where we select the picker code from the list of those previously selected in the settings;
- the seventh line is the field where we select the mushroom code from the list of those previously selected in the settings;
- eighth line - the field where you enter the number (integer).
 then click the "Save" button and below we display a table with the entered data with the following columns for the date:
"ID" (picker code),  "Date", "Day of the week", "Pick number", "Tunnel number", "Mushroom code", "Quantity".

2) If you have selected "Entering hours":
 - the fourth line is the field where you select the picker code from the list of previously selected ones in the settings;
- the fifth line is a field with the type of input - "Input" or "Output";
- the sixth line is the field where we record the current hour.
The button is "Save" and below we display a table with the entered data with the following columns for the date:
"ID" (picker code),  "Date", "Day of the week", "Type of entry", "Hour".
